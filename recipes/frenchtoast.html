        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Flour: This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour. </li>
                <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like. </li>
                <li>Eggs: Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture. </li>
                <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe. </li>
                <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
                <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth.</li>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast taste salty: </li>
                <li>Bread: You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, then whisk in the remaining ingredients. </li>
            <li>Saturate the bread slices in the batter. </li>
            <li>Cook the French toast on a lightly oiled griddle or pan until golden on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
